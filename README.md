Here lies the personal package of Corey Neff, populated with functions that I find myself using regularly. Data.table, ggplot2, and stringr are listed as dependencies
for automatic loading as I use these packages most.

## Installation

You can install the development version of corn from [GitHub](https://github.com/coreyneff/corn) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("coreyneff/corn")

## OR

# library(librarian)
# shelf("coreyneff/corn")
```
